Simple chat for my self-studying purposes. Java application with TCP-sockets.


## TODO

- Testing
- Thread management with an executor/threadpool/etc.
- Proper handling of exceptions
- Gradle build system
- GUI
- Separate connecting and asking IP-address/port
- Ask preferred server port number
- Recovering from faulty IP-address/port
- Better info messages
